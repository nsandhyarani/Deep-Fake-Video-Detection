# Deep-Fake-Video-Detection
This project implements a deepfake detection model leveraging MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and LSTM for temporal analysis. The model is designed to handle video frames efficiently with data augmentation and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. It includes custom video frame preprocessing using OpenCV and a generator to load batches dynamically. The training process is optimized with early stopping to ensure the best model performance.
